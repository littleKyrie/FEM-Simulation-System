# GAMES103-HW3
## Introduction
In this case, we will see a green house falling to the ground.

## Dynamics
We can choose to use the simple linear finite element methods or fem based on svd decomposision to acheive the effects.

The hyperelastic model is St.VK.

And We use explicit integral to update, which will cause numeric instability.

## Collision
Simple SDF collision detection and impulse responding.

## Interaction
Users can press 'space' to make it jump. If you press too hard, the impulse will be too much to make it explode.
